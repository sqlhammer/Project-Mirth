# General Concepts

## Game play

- Turn based
- Included in stats is their D&D alignments. Good, Neutral, evil, lawful, choatic
- Choices through quests always impact alignment and shifts as choices are made.
- Two sets of actions: combat actions and player interactions.
- Player interactions use a non-combactive skill and stats set.
- Combat actions follow an endurance / mana flow where your max hp is used as fuel to burn resources which you didn't acquire through environmental absorbsion.
- Skills and stats to increase environmental absorbsion.
- Excess endurance / mana slowly increases max hp.

## Interface

- Book of Heros style HUD
- Your character on the top with character stats
- Actions on the bottom
