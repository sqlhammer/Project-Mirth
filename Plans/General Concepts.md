# General Concepts

 

## Game play

 

- Turn based

- Included in stats is their D&D alignments. Good, Neutral, evil, lawful, choatic

- Choices through quests always impact alignment and shifts as choices are made.

- Two sets of actions: combat actions and player interactions.

- Player interactions use a non-combactive skill and stats set.

- Combat actions follow an endurance / mana flow where your max hp is used as fuel to burn resources which you didn't acquire through environmental absorbsion.

- Skills and stats to increase environmental absorbsion.

- Excess endurance / mana slowly increases max hp.

 

## Interface

 

- Book of Heros style HUD

- Your character on the top with character stats

- Actions on the bottom

- 1 or more enemies, as cards, in center

- Enemies can be side-by-side or cascading stacked with rotation for selecting

## Quests and Objectives

- Lore driven, semi-linear story
- Multiple branches, some which completely close off or open story arcs.
- Every quest has an alignment boost but it will never be pre-announced.
- Every quest must have a negative consequence along with the reward.
- Rewards and consequences are never announced together
- Rewards and consequences are often not explained at all until after.
- Bounty or grind style quests should always be available and sometimes appear like they are important story arc quests.

## Leveling

- Experience is built on combative and non-combative situations.
- Pretty standard unlocking skills based on minimum level unlocks.
- Earn skills points per level and spend them on two of three trees; physical, magical, non-combative.

## Items

- head
- chest (under) i.e. chainmail shirt
- chest (over) i.e. breastplate
- hands
- legs (under) i.e. leather pants
- legs (over) i.e. greaves
- feet
- left ring
- right ring
- amulet
- left earring
- right earing

## Combat

- based entirely off of various dice rolls
- ensure only standard D&D dice are used
- speed is based on agility
- not all creatures and players get the same number of turns. If speed is high enough compared to the enemy you may get an extra turn or get a higher chance at attacking first.

## Non-Combat

- unseen NPC stats during non-combative interaction
- desire
- goodwill
- trust
- indebtedness (whether you owe them or they owe you)
- opinion (built from all other stats)
